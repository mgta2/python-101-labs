# Think about a task that you want to accomplish using programming
# Maybe you want to automate something you do every day on your computer?
# Break down some of the steps you can think of and write them in
# this file as pseudocode.
# You can come back and update this file when you've learned more.
# You can also add real Python code after learning the necessary concepts.
# For now, just practice breaking larger tasks into smaller steps
# and writing out your thoughts in pseudocode.

My songs are called YOUTUBE[artist][name].mp3 so I can't see which song it
is when they come up on my phone. Want to automate the renaming process.
'''
#List artists.
#For each song, remove the 'YOUTUBE' part.
#If the song name contains something in the collection of artists:
#   Rename as [songname]-[artistname].
